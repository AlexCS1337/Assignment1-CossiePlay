<h2>About CossiePlay</h2>
<p><img src="images/winter-kingdom-798279_1920.jpg" width="275" height="255" alt="" align="left"></p>
<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.</p>
<p>We buy and sell second-hand costumes <a href="store.html">(a price list is available)</a> as well.</p>
<p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Head over to the <a href="events.html">Events</a> section for more information.</p>
<h2>Who's Who</h2></h3>
<p>The CossiePlay family is:</p>
<p>Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people enyoj their fantasies together in a family-friendly fun environment.</p>
<p>Sally Rogers – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for happy customers.</p>
